I have created an Inventory System which allows the person to manage it own inventory. 
In this project I have created a Inventory System for a Coffee Machine Seller

### Stepup Steps

#### Step 1 ðŸ”¹ Step 1: Prerequisites

Make sure you have installed:

  - .NET 8 SDK or .NET 7 SDK (check your projectâ€™s target framework in InventoryPortal.csproj)
  - SQL Server / LocalDB (your connection string uses (localdb)\MSSQLLocalDB)
  -  Visual Studio 2022 or VS Code with C# extension
  - Swagger  ( for API testing)

####  Step 2: Open the Project

Open InventoryPortal.sln in Visual Studio. OR run in terminal:

#### Step 3: Configure Database

Your appsettings.json contains:

"ConnectionStrings": {
  "DefaultConnection": "Server=(localdb)\\MSSQLLocalDB;Database=ProductsDb;Trusted_connection=true;TrustServerCertificate=true"
}

This means it will connect to a SQL Server LocalDB instance named ProductsDb

##### Open Package Manager Console (Visual Studio â†’ Tools â†’ NuGet Package Manager â†’ Package Manager Console).

- Run EF Core migrations:
- Add-Migration InitialCreate
- Update-Database
This will create your ProductsDb database and tables from your ApplicationDbContext.

#### Step 4: Run the Project

Run with:

dotnet run Or press F5 in Visual Studio.

The API will start at:

Swagger UI: https://localhost:5001/swagger (Development environment auto-enables Swagger)

API endpoints: https://localhost:5001/api/...

#### Step 5: Test API

- Open Swagger at https://localhost:5001/swagger
- Test endpoints (e.g., Products CRUD if you created controllers).
- Alternatively, use Postman to call APIs.
